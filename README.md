# Employee Tracker

This CLI application allows the user to keep a database of employee information. The user can view by employee, department, or role.  They may also add or remove an employee.  The user can update the employee's role.  They can even get a list of all the department and role titles.

Information is shown to the user in tables or lists, depending on the information they need.

## Instalation
